# 🎓 Lessons Learned: Building the Digital FTE

Building a Gold-Tier autonomous agent in 2026 revealed several critical insights into the future of "Agentic Engineering."

## 1. Perception is the Bottleneck
An AI agent is only as good as its "Watchers." We learned that separating **Perception** (lightweight Python watchers) from **Reasoning** (Claude Code) is essential for local-first performance. Relying on Claude to "poll" would be too expensive and slow.

## 2. The Power of "Unified Logic"
Cross-domain reasoning (connecting a WhatsApp message to a Bank late fee) is the "Aha!" moment of this project. It transforms the AI from a chatbot into a business partner that understands *context*, not just *text*.

## 3. Safety over Autonomy
We learned that "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) isn't a limitation; it's a feature. By using the Obsidian `/Approved` folder as a hard physical gate for the Odoo and Social MCPs, we created a system that is powerful but impossible to "run away" with financial or reputational damage.

## 4. The "Ralph Wiggum" Persistence
Persistence is what separates an assistant from an employee. Implementing the Stop Hook pattern ensures that the agent doesn't give up when a task gets hard—it iterates until it finds a solution or hits a safety limit.

## 5. Structured Audit Trails are Essential
For a business to trust an AI employee, every "Thought" and "Action" must be logged. Using JSONL for logs and Markdown for briefings creates an audit trail that is both machine-readable and human-friendly.
