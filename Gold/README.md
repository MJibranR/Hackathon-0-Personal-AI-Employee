# 🤖 Personal AI Employee (Gold Tier)

> **"Your life and business on autopilot."**  
> A local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop autonomous system for 2026.

This project delivers a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent) that proactively manages your personal and business affairs 24/7. It uses **Claude Code** as the reasoning engine, **Obsidian** as the long-term memory/GUI, and **Python/Node.js** for perception and action.

## 📁 Vault Structure
The AI Employee operates within a structured Obsidian vault:

- `/Approved`: Actions you have greenlit.
- `/Done`: Historical record of all completed work.
